# Facial Recognition using Python

Facial Recognition using Python is a project that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize human faces in images or real-time video streams. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for facial recognition tasks, with the ability to identify individuals based on facial features.


## Project Description

Facial recognition technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide range of applications, including security systems, biometric authentication, and even social media filters. This project harnesses the power of Python and various open-source libraries to implement a facial recognition system.

The core functionality of this project involves detecting and extracting facial features from images or video frames, followed by comparing these features against a pre-existing database of known individuals. The system employs machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, to learn and recognize unique facial patterns.

## Features

- Face detection: The project uses advanced computer vision algorithms to detect human faces in images or video streams.
- Facial feature extraction: Once a face is detected, the system extracts key facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth, allowing for more accurate identification.
- Face recognition: By comparing the extracted features against a database of known individuals, the system can recognize and identify people based on their unique facial characteristics.
- Real-time processing: The project supports real-time facial recognition, making it suitable for applications that require immediate identification.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained models for face detection and recognition.
4. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for the project: `python -m venv venv` and activate it.
5. Run the main script: `python main.py`.

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

## Usage

To use the facial recognition system:

1. Prepare a database of known individuals by collecting their facial images. Organize these images into individual folders, each representing a unique person.
2. Train the facial recognition model using the provided dataset using the training script: `python train.py`.
3. Capture or provide an image or video stream containing faces you want to recognize.
4. Run the facial recognition system: `python main.py`.
5. The system will detect and recognize faces, providing the name or ID of the recognized individual, if present in the database.
